BOLD Multi-Currency Picker

This is the "mount point" for Bold Multi-Currency pickers.
Include this wherever you want them to appear within your theme (can appear in multiple locations)

By default, the picker will open "up" (the currency list will appear above the indicator).
This behaviour is controlled in CSS with the "data-open" attribute, passing either "up" or "down" (eg. data-open="down")

In Liquid, you can include the snippet and pass along the openDirection variable like this:
{%- include 'bold-currency-picker-mount', openDirection: 'down' -%}

{% endcomment %}
{% assign openDirection = 'up' %}
<span style="display:none;" class="BOLD-mc-picker-mnt" data-open="{{openDirection}}" data-bold-mc-picker-mnt></span>
